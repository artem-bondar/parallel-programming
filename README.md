# Parallel programming

A simple OpenMP/MPI project created under CMC MSU supercomputers and parallel data processing course.
The target of the project is development of a parallel version of the program for the Jacobi
relaxation method for 2D matrices. The programs were run on Bluegene and Regatta supercomputers
along with on various desktop/notebooks processors.
